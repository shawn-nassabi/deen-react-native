# Deen — Supabase Auth Migration

## What This Is

Deen is a React Native / Expo mobile app for Islamic learning, featuring an AI chat assistant, Hikmah lesson trees, and an Islamic references search. The app is currently live with AWS Cognito authentication, and this project migrates the frontend authentication layer to Supabase Auth to match the already-migrated backend.

## Core Value

Users can sign in and access all features without authentication getting in their way — the migration is seamless and the app feels polished.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Existing working features that must continue to work after the migration. -->

- ✓ AI chat with streaming responses and conversation history — existing
- ✓ Hikmah learning system (trees, lessons, per-page quizzes, progress tracking) — existing
- ✓ Islamic references search — existing
- ✓ Dark/light theming with system preference support — existing
- ✓ Lesson elaboration modal (shared between chat and lesson reader) — existing
- ✓ Chat history drawer and session management — existing
- ✓ Reference copy/share functionality — existing

### Validated in Phase 1.1

- ✓ `utils/supabase.ts` singleton with `LargeSecureStore` adapter and AppState token-refresh wiring — Validated in Phase 1.1: client-infrastructure
- ✓ URL polyfill (`react-native-url-polyfill/auto`) as first import in `utils/polyfills.ts` — Validated in Phase 1.1: client-infrastructure
- ✓ `utils/config.ts` updated to `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; all Cognito fields removed — Validated in Phase 1.1: client-infrastructure

### Validated in Phase 1.2

- ✓ `utils/auth.ts` rewritten as Supabase thin wrapper — `signIn`, `signOut`, `signUp`, `getValidAccessToken`; no Cognito code — Validated in Phase 1.2: auth-core-login-ui
- ✓ `hooks/useAuth.tsx` rewired to `onAuthStateChange` with INITIAL_SESSION capture; same public API surface (`status`, `user`, `accessToken`, `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `refresh`) — Validated in Phase 1.2: auth-core-login-ui
- ✓ `app/login.tsx` replaced with elevated email+password card form (Montserrat, brand gradient button, show/hide toggle, inline errors, loading states) — Validated in Phase 1.2: auth-core-login-ui
- ✓ `app/signup.tsx` created — Sign Up screen mirroring login card; error-maps Supabase messages — Validated in Phase 1.2: auth-core-login-ui
- ✓ `app/_layout.tsx` updated — signup route registered; `isOnAuthScreen` guard prevents redirect loops — Validated in Phase 1.2: auth-core-login-ui

### Validated in Phase 1.3

- ✓ Password reset ("Forgot password") flow via Supabase email — three-state screen (request → sent → new password), deep-link token handled in `app/_layout.tsx` — Validated in Phase 1.3: password-reset-flow
- ✓ Auto token refresh using Supabase session management — Supabase client handles refresh automatically via `onAuthStateChange`; `getValidAccessToken()` returns current session token — Validated in Phase 1.3: password-reset-flow

### Validated in Phase 1.4

- ✓ Replace all `user?.email || user?.sub` usage with `user.id` (Supabase UUID) in hikmah.tsx, [lessonId].tsx, ElaborationModal.tsx — Validated in Phase 1.4: cleanup-account
- ✓ `/user-progress` and elaboration calls send Supabase UUID as `user_id` — Validated in Phase 1.4: cleanup-account
- ✓ Account deletion (`DELETE /account/me`) works with Supabase Bearer token — `deleteAccount()` in api.ts; Delete Account UI in Settings — Validated in Phase 1.4: cleanup-account
- ✓ `expo-auth-session` and `expo-web-browser` removed from `package.json`, `app.json`, and node_modules — Validated in Phase 1.4: cleanup-account
- ✓ `app/auth.tsx` OAuth callback handler deleted; `AuthUser.sub` alias removed — Validated in Phase 1.4: cleanup-account

### Active

<!-- Migration complete — all requirements satisfied as of Phase 1.4 -->

### Out of Scope

- Google OAuth / Apple Sign In — not requested; can be added in a future phase
- Migrating existing Cognito user accounts — fresh start; users will re-register
- Redesigning non-auth screens — only login screen UI is in scope
- Backend changes — backend migration to Supabase is already complete

## Context

**Backend migration:** The FastAPI backend now validates Supabase JWTs instead of Cognito JWTs. All routes now require a valid Bearer token (previously most were optional). A `GET /account/me` endpoint returns the authenticated user's identity from the JWT.

**Migration guide:** `docs/FRONTEND_AUTH_MIGRATION.md` documents all API contract changes. Key points:
- Token source: Supabase client (`session.access_token`) replaces Cognito session token
- User ID format: Supabase UUID replaces Cognito email/sub string
- Local dev bypass: `ENV=development` on the backend accepts any Bearer value; use `Authorization: Bearer dev`

**Current auth implementation (Phase 1.4 complete — migration done):**
- `utils/auth.ts` — Supabase thin wrappers (`signIn`, `signOut`, `signUp`, `getValidAccessToken`); no Cognito code
- `utils/supabase.ts` — Supabase JS client with `LargeSecureStore` adapter and AppState token-refresh wiring
- `hooks/useAuth.tsx` — `AuthProvider` + `useAuth` context via `onAuthStateChange`; exposes `status`, `user`, `accessToken`, `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `refresh`; `AuthUser` has `id` and `email` only (no `sub`)
- `app/login.tsx` — elevated card form with email+password, error states, loading spinner
- `app/signup.tsx` — Sign Up screen mirroring login card design
- `app/reset-password.tsx` — three-state password reset screen (request OTP → sent confirmation → new password)
- `app/settings.tsx` — includes Delete Account button with Alert confirmation and auto sign-out on success
- `utils/api.ts` — exports `deleteAccount()` calling `DELETE /account/me` with Supabase Bearer token
- All Cognito packages (`expo-auth-session`, `expo-web-browser`) removed; `app/auth.tsx` deleted

**Supabase SDK for React Native:** Use `@supabase/supabase-js` with `AsyncStorage` adapter for session persistence. Expo Secure Store can be used as the storage adapter for better security.

**Brand:** Montserrat font family, dark/light theme tokens in `constants/theme.ts`. Login screen should feel premium and on-brand — not a bare utility form.

**User ID concern flagged in CONCERNS.md:** Several components pass `user?.email || user?.sub` as `user_id` to the backend — this must all be replaced with the Supabase `session.user.id` UUID.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** React Native / Expo — must work in both Expo Go and standalone builds
- **Storage:** Tokens must be stored securely; use `expo-secure-store` as the Supabase storage adapter
- **Compatibility:** Must not break any existing chat, hikmah, or references features
- **API contract:** Follow `docs/FRONTEND_AUTH_MIGRATION.md` exactly — backend is already deployed
- **No secrets in repo:** `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` go in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars, not hardcoded

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Email + password only (no social login) | Simplest migration path; social login can be added later | — Pending |
| Fresh start (no Cognito user migration) | Avoids complex account linking; app is early-stage | — Pending |
| Keep `useAuth` hook API surface the same | Minimizes changes to screens and components that consume auth state | — Pending |
| Functional + elegant login UI (not full redesign) | Delivers polish without scope creep | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
